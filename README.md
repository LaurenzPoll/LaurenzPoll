# Hello, world! üëã

My name is Laurenz, a dedicated student at Fontys University of Applied Sciences.

I'm in my final year of HBO-ICT, specializing in AI, and working as a student employee on building a Large Language Model(LLM) framework.
After completing the Smart Supply Chain semester, I am now starting into **Advanced AI**, exploring reinforcement learning and neural networks.

## üìö About Me

I chose to specialize in **AI** because I wanted to learn the **magic** behind **the predictions of a machine**, this can often feel like wizardry.

During my studies, I have worked on projects in the following areas:
- **Asynchronous programming** to optimize speed of a program.
- **Machine learning fundamentals**, including AI/ML project methodology, data understanding/preparation and statistical models.
- **Web development in Laravel**, building a functional website.
- **International collaboration as a Product Owner**, leading a project between **Fontys University** and **Zhengzhou University of Light Industry** to develop a **quickscan tool for the Digital Product Passport**.

My goal is to **continuously learn, optimize, and innovate** in everything I build.
