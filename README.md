## 📚 About Me
Driven by curiosity for how intelligent systems work, I specialize in **AI engineering**—with a focus on NLP and applied machine learning. I have a track record of building software, leading international collaborations and quickly adapting to emerging technologies.

I chose to specialize in **AI** because I wanted to learn the **magic** behind **the predictions of a machine**, this can often feel like wizardry.


## 🧑‍💻 What I Do

- **Building LLM frameworks** as a student employee, bridging theory and production.
- **Exploring advanced AI** topics: neural networks, RL, deep learning, and generative AI.
- **Past projects:**
  - **Art-classifier:** Built an ML model for artwork categorization.
  - **RL-exercise-FrozenLake:** Implemented reinforcement learning using Gymnasium.
  - **Knowledge Graph Agent:** Developed an interactive Streamlit app to build/query knowledge graphs from large document sets.
  - **Fundamental Analysis Rating:** Created a stock recommendation system.
  - **Digital Product Passport:** International project lead: digital product passport tool (**Fontys University** and **Zhengzhou University of Light Industry**)
  - **Laravel web development (full stack)**
