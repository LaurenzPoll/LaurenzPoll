My name is Laurenz, a dedicated student at Fontys University of Applied Sciences.

I'm currently in my final year, specializing in AI while also working as a student employee. 
I will soon be starting the Advanced AI semester, where I'll learn more about techniques like reinforcement learning and neural networks and their real-world applications.

## üìö About Me

  

I‚Äôm studying ICT & Software with an specialization in AI at Fontys and have always had an interest in technology.

My studies have allowed me to experience different areas of software development, from the logical challenges of back-end to the visual creativity of front-end design. Outside of my studies, I'm a car enthusiast. I'm fascinated by the advanced technology in modern vehicles and the designs that make each model unique.

I take every challenge head-on, seeing it as an opportunity to learn, adapt, and improve.

  
  

## üöÄ What Drives Me

  

What drives me about software development is the endless opportunity for learning and growth.

There's always a new language to learn, a new problem to solve, and a new technology to understand.

It's a field where my ideas can take shape and come to life in the form of software.

This continual learning and the ability to create make me excited about what projects and opportunities the future holds.
