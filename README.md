## üìö About Me

  

I‚Äôm studying ICT & Software at Fontys and have always had an interest in technology.

My studies have allowed me to experience different areas of software development, from the logical challenges of back-end to the visual creativity of front-end design. Outside of my studies, I'm a car enthusiast. I'm fascinated by the advanced technology in modern vehicles and the designs that make each model unique.

I take every challenge head-on, seeing it as an opportunity to learn, adapt, and improve.

  
  

## üöÄ What Drives Me

  

What drives me about software development is the endless opportunity for learning and growth.

There's always a new language to learn, a new problem to solve, and a new technology to understand.

It's a field where my ideas can take shape and come to life in the form of software.

This continual learning and the ability to create make me excited about what projects and opportunities the future holds.

  

## üõ†Ô∏è Current Project

  

I'm currently working on a car maintenance application as part of my semester project. It's a user-friendly app aimed at assisting car owners with routine maintenance and service scheduling.
